                <p>
                    Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems maintain comfortable and healthy indoor 
                    environments. HVAC design integrates thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer to control 
                    temperature, humidity, and air quality efficiently.

                <h3>Psychrometrics</h3>

                <h4>Humid Air Properties</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Psychrometrics:
  Study of moist air properties
  
  Air-water vapor mixture behavior

Dry-Bulb Temperature (T_db or DBT):
  Temperature measured by standard thermometer
  
  Units: °C or °F
  
  Independent property (primary axis)

Humidity Ratio (ω or W):
  Mass of water vapor per mass of dry air
  
  ω = m_v/m_a  (kg_water/kg_dry_air or lb_w/lb_da)
  
  Also called: Absolute humidity, mixing ratio
  
  From ideal gas:
    ω = 0.622 · p_v/(p - p_v)
  
  Where:
    p_v = partial pressure of vapor
    p = total atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa)

Relative Humidity (φ or RH):
  Ratio of actual vapor to saturated vapor
  
  φ = p_v/p_g(T) × 100%
  
  Where p_g = saturation pressure at T
  
  Range: 0% (dry) to 100% (saturated)
  
  Comfort: 30-60% RH

Dew Point Temperature (T_dp):
  Temperature at which condensation begins
  
  Air cooled at constant ω until φ = 100%
  
  Lower than T_db (unless saturated)

Wet-Bulb Temperature (T_wb):
  Temperature with water evaporation
  
  Measured by thermometer with wet wick
  
  Lower than T_db (latent cooling)
  
  T_dp ≤ T_wb ≤ T_db

Specific Enthalpy (h):
  Total energy per unit mass of dry air
  
  h = c_p·T + ω·h_g
  
  Where:
    c_p = 1.006 kJ/kg·K (dry air)
    h_g ≈ 2501 kJ/kg (vapor at 0°C)
  
  Approximate:
    h ≈ 1.006·T + ω(2501 + 1.86·T)  kJ/kg_da
  
  Units: kJ/kg_dry_air or Btu/lb_da

Specific Volume (v):
  Volume per unit mass of dry air
  
  v ≈ 0.287·(T + 273.15)/(p - p_v)  m³/kg_da
  
  Or: v ≈ 0.287·T/p + 0.462·ω·T/p
  
  Standard: v ≈ 0.83 m³/kg at 20°C, 50% RH

Saturation Curve:
  φ = 100% line on psychrometric chart
  
  Maximum ω for given T
  
  Equations (approximate):
    p_g(T) = exp[a - b/(T+c)]  (Antoine equation)
  
  Or use steam tables, correlations

                <h4>Psychrometric Chart</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Psychrometric Chart:
  Graphical representation of moist air properties
  
  ASHRAE Chart most common

Axes:
  Horizontal: Dry-bulb temperature (T_db)
  Vertical: Humidity ratio (ω)

Curves/Lines:
  Saturation curve: φ = 100% (upper left boundary)
  Constant RH: Curved lines (φ = 20%, 40%, 60%, etc.)
  Constant wet-bulb: Diagonal lines (slope down-right)
  Constant enthalpy: Nearly parallel to wet-bulb
  Constant specific volume: Diagonal lines (slope up-right)

Reading Chart:
  Locate point: T_db and one other property
    (e.g., T_db = 25°C, φ = 60%)
  
  Read all other properties:
    ω, T_wb, T_dp, h, v

State Point:
  Defines condition of air
  
  Two independent properties needed
  
  Common pairs:
    - T_db and φ
    - T_db and T_wb
    - T_db and ω

Psychrometric Processes:

1. Sensible Heating:
   Heat added, no moisture change
   
   ω = constant (horizontal right)
   φ decreases (drier feeling)
   
   Example: Furnace, electric heater

2. Sensible Cooling:
   Heat removed, no moisture change
   
   ω = constant (horizontal left)
   φ increases
   
   If reach saturation: Condensation begins

3. Cooling with Dehumidification:
   Cool below dew point
   
   Follows saturation curve (φ = 100%)
   ω decreases (moisture removed)
   
   Example: Air conditioning coil
   
   Apparatus Dew Point (ADP):
     Effective coil surface temperature
     On saturation curve
   
   Bypass Factor (BF):
     Fraction of air not contacting coil
     BF = (T_out - T_ADP)/(T_in - T_ADP)

4. Humidification:
   Add moisture
   
   Adiabatic (evaporative):
     Constant wet-bulb (diagonal down-left)
     T_db decreases, ω increases
     Example: Evaporative cooler
   
   Steam injection:
     Constant dry-bulb (vertical up)
     T increases slightly (superheat)

5. Dehumidification:
   Remove moisture (overcooling then reheat)
   
   Or desiccant systems

6. Mixing:
   Combine two airstreams
   
   State 3 on straight line between states 1 and 2
   
   Mass balance:
     ṁ₃ = ṁ₁ + ṁ₂
   
   Property balance (for ω, h, etc.):
     ṁ₃·ω₃ = ṁ₁·ω₁ + ṁ₂·ω₂
   
   Mixing point location:
     Lever rule (mass ratio)

                <h3>Load Calculations</h3>

                <h4>Cooling Load Components</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Cooling Load:
  Heat gain that must be removed
  
  Total = Sensible + Latent

Sensible Load (Q_sensible):
  Temperature change only
  
  Sources:

1. Transmission (Envelope):
   Heat through walls, roof, windows, floor
   
   Q = U·A·CLTD
   
   Or simplified:
     Q = U·A·ΔT
   
   Where:
     U = overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K)
     A = area (m²)
     CLTD = cooling load temperature difference
     ΔT = T_outside - T_inside

   Typical U-values:
     Uninsulated wall: 2-3 W/m²·K
     Insulated wall (R-13): 0.4 W/m²·K
     Single-pane window: 5-6 W/m²·K
     Double-pane: 2-3 W/m²·K
     Triple-pane: 1-2 W/m²·K

2. Solar Radiation (Windows):
   Q_solar = A·SHGC·SC·SCL
   
   Or: Q = A·SHGC·I_solar
   
   Where:
     SHGC = solar heat gain coefficient (0-1)
       Clear glass: 0.8
       Low-E: 0.4-0.6
       Reflective: 0.2-0.4
     I_solar = incident solar radiation (W/m²)
       Peak ≈ 800-1000 W/m² (perpendicular)

3. Infiltration/Ventilation:
   Outside air entering
   
   Q_inf = ṁ·c_p·ΔT = ρ·V̇·c_p·ΔT
   
   Where:
     V̇ = volumetric flow rate (m³/s or CFM)
     ΔT = T_outside - T_inside
     ρ ≈ 1.2 kg/m³, c_p ≈ 1.006 kJ/kg·K
   
   Simplified:
     Q (W) = 1.2·V̇(m³/s)·ΔT(K)
     Q (Btu/h) = 1.08·V̇(CFM)·ΔT(°F)
   
   Infiltration rate:
     Air changes per hour (ACH)
     Typical: 0.5-2 ACH
     
     V̇ = (ACH/60)·Volume

4. Internal Gains:
   People:
     Sensible: 60-75 W/person (sedentary)
                100-150 W/person (active)
     ASHRAE tables by activity
   
   Lights:
     Q = Wattage × factor
     Incandescent: 100% sensible
     Fluorescent: ~90% sensible (ballast heat)
     LED: Lower heat
   
   Equipment:
     Computers, appliances, machinery
     Nameplate power (with usage factor)

Latent Load (Q_latent):
  Moisture addition (no temperature change)
  
  Sources:

1. People:
   Latent: 30-60 W/person (sedentary)
           150-300 W/person (active)
   
   Higher in hot, humid climates

2. Infiltration/Ventilation:
   Moisture in outside air
   
   Q_lat = ṁ·h_fg·Δω = ρ·V̇·h_fg·Δω
   
   Where:
     h_fg ≈ 2501 kJ/kg (latent heat)
     Δω = ω_outside - ω_inside
   
   Simplified:
     Q (W) = 3000·V̇(m³/s)·Δω(kg/kg)
     Q (Btu/h) = 4840·V̇(CFM)·Δω(lb/lb)

3. Cooking, Showers:
   Significant in kitchens, bathrooms

Total Cooling Load:
  Q_total = Q_sensible + Q_latent
  
  Units: W, kW, Btu/h, tons refrigeration
  
  1 ton = 12,000 Btu/h = 3.517 kW

Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR):
  SHR = Q_sensible / Q_total
  
  Range: 0.6-0.95 (typical buildings)
  
  Higher SHR: More sensible (dry climates)
  Lower SHR: More latent (humid climates)
  
  Important for equipment selection

<code>Heating Load:
  Heat loss to be replaced
  
  Winter design conditions

Components:

1. Transmission:
   Q = U·A·(T_inside - T_outside)
   
   Same U-values as cooling
   
   Design ΔT larger (winter extreme)

2. Infiltration:
   Cold air entering
   
   Q = 1.2·V̇·ΔT  (W, m³/s, K)
   
   Higher in winter (stack effect, wind)

3. Ventilation:
   Required outside air
   
   Q = ṁ·c_p·ΔT + ṁ·h_fg·Δω
   
   Sensible + humidification load

4. Pickup Load:
   Morning warm-up (thermostat setback recovery)
   
   Percentage of design load (10-30%)

  99%: Temperature exceeded 1% of hours
  (approximately 88 hours per year)
  
  Example: Minneapolis 99% = -23°C (-10°F)

Total Heating Load:
  Q_heating = Q_transmission + Q_infiltration + Q_ventilation
  
  Units: W, kW, Btu/h

Humidification:
  Moisture addition (dry winter air)
  
  Q_hum = ṁ·h_fg·Δω
  
  Steam or evaporative humidifiers

                <h4>Example: Cooling Load Calculation</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Problem:
  Office 5m × 6m × 3m high
  Outside: 35°C, 60% RH
  Inside: 24°C, 50% RH
  
  Walls: U = 0.5 W/m²·K, total area 40 m²
  Windows: 10 m², SHGC = 0.6, U = 2.5 W/m²·K
  Solar radiation: 500 W/m² (average)
  
  Infiltration: 0.5 ACH
  Occupancy: 4 people (70 W sensible, 50 W latent each)
  Lights: 500 W (all sensible)
  
  Find: Total cooling load, SHR

Solution:

1. Wall transmission:
   Q_wall = U·A·ΔT = 0.5·40·(35-24) = 220 W

2. Window transmission:
   Q_window,trans = 2.5·10·(35-24) = 275 W

3. Solar gain (windows):
   Q_solar = A·SHGC·I = 10·0.6·500 = 3000 W

4. Infiltration:
   Volume = 5·6·3 = 90 m³
   V̇ = 0.5 ACH · 90 m³ / 60 min = 0.75 m³/min = 0.0125 m³/s
   
   Sensible:
   Q_inf,sens = 1.2·V̇·ΔT = 1.2·0.0125·(35-24) = 165 W
   
   Latent (need ω values from chart):
   At 35°C, 60% RH: ω ≈ 0.021 kg/kg
   At 24°C, 50% RH: ω ≈ 0.0093 kg/kg
   Δω = 0.021 - 0.0093 = 0.0117 kg/kg
   
   Q_inf,lat = 3000·V̇·Δω = 3000·0.0125·0.0117 = 439 W

5. People:
   Q_people,sens = 4·70 = 280 W
   Q_people,lat = 4·50 = 200 W

6. Lights:
   Q_lights = 500 W (all sensible)

7. Total sensible:
   Q_sens = 220 + 275 + 3000 + 165 + 280 + 500 = 4440 W

8. Total latent:
   Q_lat = 439 + 200 = 639 W

9. Total cooling load:
   Q_total = 4440 + 639 = 5079 W ≈ 5.1 kW
   
   In tons: 5.1 / 3.517 = 1.45 tons

10. Sensible Heat Ratio:
    SHR = 4440 / 5079 = 0.87
    
    (High SHR, mostly sensible load)

System Selection:
  Need 1.5-2 ton AC unit
  Must handle SHR = 0.87
  Supply air temperature and humidity determined by SHR

COP (Coefficient of Performance):
  Cooling: COP_R = Q_evap / W_comp
  
  Typical: COP = 2.5-4.5 (air conditioning)
  
  Higher is better (more efficient)

Refrigerants:

    GWP: Global Warming Potential (want low)

Future:
  Natural refrigerants: CO₂ (R-744), ammonia, propane
  Low-GWP synthetics: R-32, R-1234yf

Superheat and Subcooling:

Superheat:
  Vapor temperature above saturation
  At evaporator outlet
  
  Superheat = T₁ - T_sat(P₁)
  
  Ensures no liquid to compressor
  Typical: 5-10°C

Subcooling:
  Liquid temperature below saturation
  At condenser outlet
  
  Subcooling = T_sat(P₃) - T₃
  
  Ensures liquid to expansion valve
  Increases capacity
  Typical: 3-8°C

                <h3>Air Distribution and Ductwork</h3>

                <h4>Duct Design</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Duct System:
  Deliver conditioned air to spaces
  Return air to equipment

Duct Sizing Methods:

1. Velocity Method:
   Select duct size for target velocity
   
   Velocities:
     Main ducts: 4-6 m/s (800-1200 fpm)
     Branch ducts: 3-5 m/s (600-1000 fpm)
     
     Lower for quiet (libraries, bedrooms)
     Higher for industrial
   
   Area = Q / v
   
   Where Q = flow rate (m³/s or CFM)

2. Equal Friction Method:
   Constant pressure loss per length
   
   Typical: 0.8-1.5 Pa/m (0.1 in.w.g./100 ft)
   
   Size ducts to maintain friction rate
   
   Balanced system

3. Static Regain Method:
   Velocity reduction regains static pressure
   
   Maintains pressure at branches
   
   Complex, large systems

Friction Loss:
  Darcy-Weisbach (or simplified charts)
  
  Δp = f·(L/D)·(ρv²/2)
  
  Higher velocity → higher loss (v² relationship)

Duct Shapes:
  Round: Lowest pressure loss, lowest material
  Rectangular: Fits above ceilings (flat)
  Oval: Compromise

Equivalent Diameter:
  Convert rectangular to round
  
  D_eq = 1.30·[(ab)^0.625] / [(a+b)^0.25]
  
  Where a, b = rectangular dimensions

Fittings and Losses:
  Elbows, transitions, branches
  
  Loss coefficient (C) or equivalent length
  
  Minimize sharp turns, sudden changes

Diffusers and Grilles:
  Deliver air to space
  
  Types:
    Diffuser: Multi-directional (ceiling)
    Register: Adjustable (wall, floor)
    Grille: Return air
  
  Throw: Distance air travels before velocity drops
  
  Select for coverage, noise, aesthetics

Duct Insulation:
  Exterior: Reduce heat gain/loss
  Interior liner: Acoustic dampening
  
  R-value: R-4 to R-8 typical

Duct Leakage:
  Seal joints (mastic, tape)
  
  Leakage class: 3-48 (lower is better)
  
  Can lose 10-30% airflow to leaks!

                <h4>System Balancing</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Air Balancing:
  Adjust airflow to design values
  
  Process:
    1. Measure airflow at each outlet
    2. Adjust dampers
    3. Repeat until balanced

Dampers:
  Volume dampers: Manually adjusted
  Balancing dampers: Fine-tune branches
  Fire dampers: Close in fire (safety)
  
  Automated: VAV (variable air volume) boxes

Hydronic Balancing:
  Water flow in piping
  
  Balancing valves at each terminal
  
  Differential pressure readouts

Testing and Commissioning:
  Verify system performance
  
  Airflow, temperatures, pressures
  Control sequences
  
  Before occupancy
