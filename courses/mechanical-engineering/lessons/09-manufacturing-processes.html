                <h3>Introduction to Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>
                    Manufacturing transforms raw materials into finished products through various physical and chemical 
                    processes. Understanding manufacturing capabilities and limitations is essential for designing 
                    parts that are functional, economical, and manufacturable.

                <h3>Casting Processes</h3>

                <h4>Fundamentals of Casting</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Casting Process:
  Pour molten metal into mold cavity
  Allow to solidify
  Remove part (and possibly mold)

Advantages:
  + Complex geometries
  + Large parts possible
  + Internal cavities
  + Near-net shape (less machining)
  + Wide material selection

Disadvantages:
  - Porosity possible
  - Rough surface finish
  - Less precise tolerances
  - Solidification defects

Mold Materials:
  Expendable: Sand, plaster, ceramic (one use)
  Permanent: Metal, graphite (multiple uses)

Design Considerations:

Shrinkage:
  Metal contracts during solidification
  
  Typical shrinkage allowances:
    Cast iron: 1%
    Steel: 2%
    Aluminum: 1.3%
    Brass: 1.5%
  
  Pattern oversized by shrinkage %

Draft:
  Taper for part removal
  
  Typical: 1-3° for sand, 2-5° for permanent mold

Fillets and Radii:
  Avoid sharp corners (stress concentration, cracking)
  
  Minimum radius ≈ 3 mm

Uniform Wall Thickness:
  Uneven thickness → differential cooling → defects
  
  If variation needed: gradual transition

Parting Line:
  Where mold halves meet
  
  Choose to minimize complexity

Gating and Risers:
  Gating: Channel for molten metal entry
  Riser (feeder): Reservoir to compensate shrinkage
  
  Proper design prevents:
    - Shrinkage cavities
    - Incomplete filling
    - Trapped gas

                </div>

                <h4>Casting Methods</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Sand Casting:
  Most common (60% of all castings)
  
  Process:
    1. Make pattern (wood, plastic, metal)
    2. Pack sand around pattern (green sand = clay binder)
    3. Remove pattern
    4. Create gating system
    5. Pour metal
    6. Cool, break mold, remove casting
  
  Advantages:
    + Low cost for small quantities
    + Large parts (engine blocks, machine bases)
    + All metals
  
  Disadvantages:
    - Rough surface (Ra ≈ 12-25 μm)
    - Wide tolerances (±1-2 mm)
    - Labor-intensive
  
  Variations:
    Shell molding: Thin shell (better finish)
    No-bake: Chemical binder (no baking)

Die Casting:
  Permanent metal mold, pressure injection
  
  Process:
    1. Close steel dies
    2. Inject molten metal under pressure (10-150 MPa)
    3. Cool rapidly
    4. Open dies, eject part
  
  Advantages:
    + Excellent surface finish (Ra ≈ 0.8-1.6 μm)
    + Tight tolerances (±0.1-0.2 mm)
    + High production rate
    + Thin walls possible (0.5 mm)
  
  Disadvantages:
    - High tooling cost
    - Limited to low-melting alloys (Zn, Al, Mg, Cu)
    - Part size limited (typically < 50 kg)
  
  Types:
    Hot chamber: Metal in machine (Zn, Mg, Pb)
    Cold chamber: Ladled metal (Al, Cu, high-melting)

Investment Casting (Lost Wax):
  Precision casting
  
  Process:
    1. Inject wax into metal die (pattern)
    2. Assemble wax patterns on tree
    3. Coat with ceramic slurry, dry (shell)
    4. Melt out wax
    5. Preheat shell, pour metal
    6. Break shell, remove parts
  
  Advantages:
    + Excellent accuracy (±0.05-0.15 mm)
    + Smooth surface (Ra ≈ 1.6-3.2 μm)
    + Complex geometries, undercuts
    + All metals (including high-temp alloys)
  
  Disadvantages:
    - Expensive
    - Small-medium parts
    - Longer lead time
  
  Applications:
    Turbine blades, dental crowns, jewelry

Permanent Mold Casting:
  Reusable metal mold, gravity pour
  
  Better than sand: Finer grain, better properties
  Lower cost than die casting (no high pressure)
  
  Variations:
    Centrifugal: Rotating mold (pipes, rings)
    Low-pressure: Slight pressure for filling

Continuous Casting:
  Solidify while withdrawing from mold
  
  Products: Slabs, billets, blooms (semi-finished)
  Used in steel and aluminum production

                <h3>Bulk Deformation Processes</h3>

                <h4>Forging</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Forging:
  Plastically deform metal using compressive forces
  
  Advantages:
    + Improved grain flow (strength)
    + Refined grain structure
    + Elimination of defects
    + High strength-to-weight
  
  Temperature:
    Hot forging: Above recrystallization T
      Easier deformation, lower forces
      Steel: 1100-1250°C
    
    Cold forging: Room temperature
      Higher strength, better finish
      Work hardening occurs

Open-Die Forging:
  Simple dies, no complete cavity
  
  Operations:
    Upsetting: Compress height, increase diameter
    Drawing out: Elongate, reduce cross-section
  
  Applications:
    Large parts (shafts, turbine discs)
    Custom, low volume

Closed-Die (Impression-Die) Forging:
  Metal forced into die cavity
  
  Process:
    1. Heat billet
    2. Place in bottom die
    3. Top die descends, metal flows into cavity
    4. Flash forms (excess metal in gap)
    5. Trim flash
  
  Flash:
    Beneficial: Restricts flow, fills cavity
    Removed: Trimming operation
  
  Draft: 3-10° (for removal)
  
  Parting line: Die separation plane
  
  Applications:
    Automotive (crankshafts, connecting rods)
    Aerospace (landing gear)
    Tools (wrenches, hammers)

Forging Equipment:
  Hammers: Impact force, kinetic energy
    Drop hammer, power hammer
  
  Presses: Squeezing force, hydraulic/mechanical
    Slower, controlled deformation

Design Guidelines:
  - Avoid sharp corners (use radii)
  - Uniform thickness preferred
  - Consider grain flow direction
  - Parting line on largest dimension
  - Draft angles for removal

                </div>

                <h4>Rolling, Extrusion, and Drawing</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Rolling:
  Reduce thickness by passing through rotating rolls
  
  Flat Rolling:
    Produce sheets and plates
    
    Reduction:
      Δh = h₀ - h_f
      %Reduction = Δh/h₀ × 100%
    
    Roll force: F = σ_avg · L · w
    Where L = contact length
    
    Multiple passes: Gradual reduction
  
  Shape Rolling:
    Produce I-beams, rails, structural shapes
    Contoured rolls
  
  Thread Rolling:
    Form threads by rolling (vs cutting)
    Stronger (grain flow intact)

Extrusion:
  Force material through die opening
  
  Direct Extrusion:
    Billet pushed, die stationary
    Ram force: P = A₀·σ_avg·ln(A₀/A_f)
  
  Indirect (Backward) Extrusion:
    Die moves, billet stationary
    Lower friction
  
  Hot extrusion: Al, Cu, Mg, steel
  Cold extrusion: Al (toothpaste tubes), steel (small parts)
  
  Shapes:
    Solid: Rods, complex profiles (window frames)
    Hollow: Tubes, pipes
  
  Advantages:
    + Continuous length

  Reduction in area per pass: 20-50%
  
  Multiple dies in series (tandem drawing)
  
  Die angle: 6-20° (balance force and length)
  
  Drawing stress:
    σ_d = σ_avg·ln(A₀/A_f)
  
  Lubricants critical (reduce friction, heat)
  
  Applications:
    Wire: Electrical cables, springs, fasteners
    Tubes: Seamless tubing, precision tubes

                <h3>Sheet Metal Forming</h3>

                <h4>Bending and Forming Operations</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Sheet Metal Characteristics:
  Thickness: 0.1-10 mm (typically)
  Large surface area to thickness ratio

Bending:
  Deform along straight axis
  
  Bend Allowance:
    L_total = L₁ + L₂ + BA
    
    BA = α(R + K_T·t)
    
    Where:
      α = bend angle (radians)
      R = bend radius
      t = sheet thickness
      K_T = K-factor (neutral axis position, ≈ 0.33-0.5)
  
  Minimum Bend Radius:
    Too small → cracking
    
    Ductile materials: R_min ≈ 0.5t
    Less ductile: R_min ≈ 2-3t

Springback:
  Elastic recovery after bending
  
  Final angle < formed angle
  
  Springback factor:
    K_s = (90°-α_f)/(90°-α_i)
  
  Where:
    α_i = initial angle (tool)
    α_f = final angle (after springback)
  
  Compensation:
    Overbend or bottoming (force into die)

Punching and Blanking:
  Shearing operation
  
  Punching: Remove slug (hole)
  Blanking: Slug becomes part
  
  Clearance: Gap between punch and die
    c = (0.05-0.1) × t  (typical for steel)
  
  Too small: Poor edge, die wear
  Too large: Large burr
  
  Shear force:
    F_s = 0.7·S_ut·t·L
    
    Where L = perimeter length
  
  Nibbling: Series of overlapping punches

Deep Drawing:
  Form cup/box from flat blank
  
  Limiting Drawing Ratio (LDR):
    LDR = D_blank/d_punch  (max ≈ 2.0-2.2)
  
  Beyond LDR: Redrawing needed (multiple operations)
  
  Blank holder: Prevent wrinkling
  
  Drawing force:
    F_d = πd_p·t·σ_avg·(D_b/d_p - 0.7)
  
  Anisotropy:
    Earing: Uneven height due to grain direction
  
  Applications:
    Beverage cans, automotive body panels

Formability:
  Strain limits before failure
  
  Forming Limit Diagram (FLD):
    Major strain vs minor strain
    Safe zone below curve

                <h3>Machining Processes</h3>

                <h4>Fundamentals of Machining</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Machining:
  Remove material to create desired shape
  Chip formation by cutting tool

Advantages:
  + High accuracy (±0.01-0.1 mm)
  + Excellent surface finish
  + Versatile (any solid material)
  + Complex geometries

Disadvantages:
  - Material waste (chips)
  - Slower than forming
  - Higher cost for simple shapes

Cutting Parameters:

Cutting Speed (v):
  Velocity of tool relative to work surface
  
  Turning: v = πDn  (m/min or ft/min)
    Where D = diameter, n = spindle speed (rpm)
  
  Milling: v = πDn

Feed Rate (f):
  Advancement per revolution or per tooth
  
  Turning: f = mm/rev
  Milling: f_z = mm/tooth

Depth of Cut (d):
  Penetration of tool
  
  Radial (turning) or axial (milling)

Material Removal Rate (MRR):
  Volume removed per time
  
  Turning: MRR = πDdf·n = vfd
  
  Milling: MRR = a_e·a_p·v_f
    Where a_e = width, a_p = depth, v_f = feed velocity

Cutting Force and Power:
  Cutting force: F_c = k_s·A_c
    Where k_s = specific cutting force (material property)
          A_c = chip cross-section = fd
  
  Power: P_c = F_c·v / η
    Where η = machine efficiency (≈ 0.8)

Chip Formation:
  Shear deformation ahead of tool
  
  Chip types:
    Continuous: Ductile, low feed, sharp tool
    Built-up edge (BUE): Adhesion on tool (bad)
    Segmented: Medium ductility
    Discontinuous: Brittle materials
  
  Chip thickness ratio:
    r_c = t_c/t_o  (typically 2-5)
    Where t_c = chip thickness, t_o = uncut thickness

Merchant's Analysis:
  Shear plane angle (φ) minimizes energy
  
  tan(φ) = (r_c·cos(α)) / (1 - r_c·sin(α))
  
  Where α = rake angle

    Coatings: TiN, TiC, Al₂O₃ (improve wear)
  
  Use: Inserts, high-production turning/milling

Ceramics:
  Al₂O₃, Si₃N₄
  
  Hardness: Extremely high

  Second hardest to diamond
  
  Machine hardened steels (45-65 HRC)
  High-temperature stability
  
  Expensive

Diamond:
  Natural or polycrystalline (PCD)
  
  Hardest
  Best for non-ferrous (Al, Cu, composites)
  Reacts with Fe at high T
  
  Excellent finish
  Very expensive

Tool Life:
  Time until tool fails (wear, breakage)
  
  Wear mechanisms:
    Flank wear: Rubbing on workpiece
    Crater wear: Chip flow on rake face
    Notch wear: At depth of cut line
  
  Criteria: Flank wear land width (e.g., 0.3 mm)

Taylor Tool Life Equation:
  vT^n = C
  
  Where:

        HSS: n ≈ 0.1-0.15
        Carbide: n ≈ 0.2-0.4
        Ceramic: n ≈ 0.5-0.7
    C = constant
  
  Higher speed → shorter life (exponential)

Extended Form:
  vT^n·f^a·d^b = C
  
  Includes feed (f) and depth (d)

Optimum Cutting Speed:
  Balance productivity and tool cost
  
  Maximum production rate:
    v_opt = C / [T_opt^n]
    
    Where T_opt = (1-n)/n · (t_c + t_t)
      t_c = tool change time
      t_t = tool cost / labor rate

Coolants and Lubricants:
  Functions:
    - Cool tool and workpiece
    - Lubricate (reduce friction)
    - Flush chips
    - Prevent corrosion
  
  Types:
    Oils: Better lubrication, lower cooling
    Water-based: Better cooling, rust issues

                <h4>Example: Machining Calculation</h4>
                <div class="code-block" data-language="text">
<code>Problem:
  Turn steel bar from D₀=50 mm to D_f=46 mm, L=200 mm
  Cutting speed: v = 120 m/min
  Feed rate: f = 0.25 mm/rev
  Find: Spindle speed, machining time, MRR

Solution:

1. Spindle speed (use average diameter):
   D_avg = (50 + 46)/2 = 48 mm = 0.048 m
   
   n = v/(πD) = 120/(π·0.048) = 796 rpm
   
   Use: n = 800 rpm (round to available speed)

2. Depth of cut (single pass):
   d = (D₀ - D_f)/2 = (50-46)/2 = 2 mm

3. Machining time:
   t = L/(f·n) = 200/(0.25·800) = 1.0 min

4. Material Removal Rate (at D_avg):
   MRR = π·D_avg·d·f·n
       = π·48·2·0.25·800
       = 60,318 mm³/min
       = 60.3 cm³/min

Alternative (using velocity):
   MRR = v·f·d = 120,000·0.25·2 = 60,000 mm³/min
   (slight difference due to using v vs πD_avg·n)

If tool life T=45 min at this v:
   Number of parts per tool = T/t = 45/1 = 45 parts
